* [lower](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Strings/strings_lower) 🪁
* [upper](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Strings/strings_upper) 🚁
* [title](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Strings/strings_title) 🪁
* [stripping](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Strings/strings_strip1) 🪁
* [find](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Strings/str_find) 🪁


#### Fix the Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](src/fix_code_1.py) 🪁
  * Fix the code so it collects information from the user and uses it in a response with:
    * correct capitalization, whether the user entered it that way or not.
    * no spaces at the start or end of the string
      
(Be sure to test your solution with various inputs.)

* [Fix the Code #2](src/fix_code_2.py) 🪁
  * This program should get an input from the user about their favorite pizza toppings and check to see if the response contains multiple words (by looking for spaces).
  * Be sure any starting and trailing spaces are removed before checking for internal spaces. (Recall: `find()` returns the index of the first instance of the character.)  
    * GitHub will run a test on this when you submit it.


### Submitting your Repo
* When you have completed each exercise, check the repo into GitHub and check the feedback for issues. (Remember, you can modify and resubmit if/when issues are found!)
